Download instructions:
1. Click the green button on the upper right-corner of the screen that says "Clone or download." 
2. Click "Download ZIP"

This will download the entire repository. Next, un-zip the download and open the Matlab files as instructed in the tutorial. 

## IMPORTANT
Do not change the file structure of the un-zipped folder. Inside the folder are two folders with helper functions and data. This will automatically be called when needed from the main Matlab scripts.
