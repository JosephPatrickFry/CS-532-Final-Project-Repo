# CS 532 Final Project Code Repository
By [Rebekah Dix](https://github.com/rebekahanne) and [Joseph Fry](https://github.com/JosephPatrickFry).

1. [Click here to download the whole repository](http://github.com/rebekahanne/reposCS-532-Final-Project-Repoitory/archive/master.zip)
2. Open the .zip file just downloaded.
3. Open the Matlab files as instructed in the tutorial. 

## IMPORTANT
Do not change the file structure of the un-zipped folder. You can either set your Matlab filepath to this folder (called CS-532-Final-Project-Repo-master when un-zipped) or move this folder do your current path. Inside the folder are two folders with helper functions and data. These will automatically be called when needed from the main Matlab scripts.
